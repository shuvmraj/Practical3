# 🎯 QUICK START - Build #10

## What Was Wrong (Build #9)
Jenkins's `tools { jdk 'JDK_HOME' }` was overriding our JAVA_HOME environment variable with a non-existent Java path.

## What We Fixed
Removed `jdk 'JDK_HOME'` from Jenkinsfile tools section so our explicit environment JAVA_HOME takes effect.

## Ready to Build

### Navigate To:
```
http://localhost:8085/
```

### Click:
```
FullStack-CRUD-Deploy → Build Now
```

### Expected Outcome (Build #10):
```
✅ Stage 1: Checkout
✅ Stage 2: Build Frontend
✅ Stage 3: Package Frontend (75K)
✅ Stage 4: Build Backend (JAVA 21 - NOW FIXED)
✅ Stage 5: Verify Artifacts
✅ Stage 6: Deploy Backend → /springapp1
✅ Stage 7: Deploy Frontend → /frontapp1
✅ Stage 8: Verify Deployment
```

### After Success:
```
Backend:  http://localhost:9090/springapp1
Frontend: http://localhost:9090/frontapp1
Manager:  http://localhost:9090/manager/html
```

## Key Fix Applied
```groovy
// OLD: tools { jdk 'JDK_HOME', ... }  ← Caused problem
// NEW: tools { maven 'Maven_3', nodejs 'node20' }  ← Just Maven & Node

environment {
    JAVA_HOME = '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-21.jdk/Contents/Home'
    PATH = "${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"
}
```
