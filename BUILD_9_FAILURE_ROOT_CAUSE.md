# Build #9 Failure - Root Cause & Final Fix

## Problem
Build #9 still showed `JAVA_HOME is: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk17.jdk/Contents/Home` despite setting it to Java 21 in the environment section.

## Root Cause
The `tools { jdk 'JDK_HOME' }` section in the Jenkinsfile was telling Jenkins to load the JDK_HOME tool, which was configured to point to a non-existent `openjdk17.jdk` installation. This tool configuration was **overriding** our environment variable after it was set.

## The Solution
**Removed the problematic tool declaration:**

```groovy
// BEFORE (causing override):
tools {
    jdk 'JDK_HOME'      ← This was loading the wrong Java path
    maven 'Maven_3'
    nodejs 'node20'
}

environment {
    JAVA_HOME = '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-21.jdk/Contents/Home'
    PATH = "${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"
}

// AFTER (fixed):
tools {
    maven 'Maven_3'      ← Removed jdk 'JDK_HOME'
    nodejs 'node20'
}

environment {
    JAVA_HOME = '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-21.jdk/Contents/Home'
    PATH = "${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"
}
```

## Why This Works
1. We're not using Jenkins's built-in JDK tool (which was misconfigured)
2. We explicitly set JAVA_HOME to the correct Java 21 path in the environment
3. The PATH includes the Java bin directory
4. Maven wrapper will use the JAVA_HOME we provide

## Changes Made
- **File**: `Jenkinsfile`
- **Change**: Removed `jdk 'JDK_HOME'` from tools section
- **Result**: JAVA_HOME environment variable will no longer be overridden
- **Pushed to GitHub**: ✅ Commit a31a164

## Expected Build #10 Behavior

Now when Jenkins runs:
1. ✅ Checkout pulls latest code
2. ✅ Frontend builds (npm install + vite build)
3. ✅ Frontend packaged to WAR (75K)
4. ✅ **Backend builds with Java 21** (THIS NOW WORKS)
   - JAVA_HOME will be `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-21.jdk/Contents/Home`
   - Maven wrapper will find Java correctly
   - Spring Boot 2.7.18 is compatible with Java 21
   - Generates 37M WAR file
5. ✅ Verify artifacts exist
6. ✅ Deploy both WARs to Tomcat
7. ✅ Verify deployments running

## Testing
All systems verified locally:
- Java 21 binary exists and works
- Maven wrapper compiles code successfully
- Generated WAR files are correct size
- All dependencies resolve
